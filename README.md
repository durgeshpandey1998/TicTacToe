## Source Code
- <a href="https://github.com/PRATHAM-099/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/main/TicTacToe/Tic-Tac-Toe.cs">Tic-Tac-Toe.cs</a> has the source code for performing the Tic Tac Toe game in C#. It defines a 2D array of buttons to represent the game board and initializes the game board by assigning each button to its corresponding button on the form. It also declares variables to keep track of the game state, including the number of rounds played, the number of buttons clicked, the current player symbol (X or O), and the number of wins for each player.
- The ***turn_decider()*** function determines which player's turn it is based on the number of buttons clicked so far.
- The game board has event handlers for each button to handle the button click event. When a button is clicked, the ***turn_decider()*** function is called to determine the current player's symbol, and the symbol is displayed on the button and the buttons are then disabled.
- If the number of buttons clicked is greater than or equal to 5, the ***check_winner()*** function is called to check if there is a winner for the round.
- The ***check_winner()*** function checks if there is a winner for the current round by checking each row, column, and diagonal of the game board. If there is a winner, a message is displayed, the win count for the corresponding player is incremented.
- The ***necessary_calculations()*** function is called to update the score.
- The ***clear()*** function is also called to reset the game board for the next round.
